# this is a React/Node/JSON/Clojure-friendly emacs config


## Installing

1. Close Emacs.
2. Delete `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d` if they exist. (Windows users, your
   emacs files will probably live in
   `C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\`. So, for example, you
   would delete `C:\Users\jason\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d`.) This is
   where Emacs looks for configuration files, and deleting these files
   and directories will ensure that you start with a clean slate.
3. Clone the .emacs.d from https://github.com/deepakjacob/.emacs.d. Its contents should be a folder and place this folder as ~/.emacs.d

Then open Emacs.

That should install the latest version. Enjoy!

## Organization

I've tried to separate everything logically and document the purpose
of every line. [`init.el`](./init.el) acts as a kind of table of
contents.  It's a good idea to eventually go through `init.el` and the
files under the `customizations` directory so that you know exactly
what's going on.
