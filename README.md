# React, Node, JSON, Elixir and Clojure friendly emacs config


## Installing

1. Close Emacs.
2. Delete `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d` if they exist. (Windows users, your emacs files will probably live in `C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\`. 
3. Clone the .emacs.d from https://github.com/deepakjacob/.emacs.d. Its contents should be a folder and place this folder as ~/.emacs.d
4. Open Emacs.

## Organization

I've tried to separate everything logically and document the purpose
of every line. [`init.el`](./init.el) acts as a kind of table of
contents.  It's a good idea to eventually go through `init.el` and the
files under the `customizations` directory so that you know exactly
what's going on.
